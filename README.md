```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

3. Set up environment variables
   Create a `.env` file with your Firebase credentials:

   ```env
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=
   EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=
   ```

4. Start the development server
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

## Project Setup

### Metro Configuration

The project uses a custom Metro configuration to support both Firebase Auth and NativeWind (Tailwind CSS). Here's the setup in `metro.config.js`:

```javascript
const { getDefaultConfig } = require("@expo/metro-config");
const { withNativeWind } = require("nativewind/metro");

const config = getDefaultConfig(__dirname);
config.resolver.sourceExts = [...config.resolver.sourceExts, "mjs", "cjs"];

module.exports = withNativeWind(config, { input: "./global.css" });
```

This configuration:

- Adds support for Firebase's CommonJS modules
- Integrates NativeWind for Tailwind CSS support
- Extends source extensions to include "mjs" and "cjs" files

### Firebase Auth Setup

Firebase Auth is configured with React Native persistence for maintaining authentication state:

```typescript
import { initializeApp } from "firebase/app";
import { initializeAuth, getAuth } from "firebase/auth";
import AsyncStorage from "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage";

// IGNORE IMPORT ERROR, this is a valid import, still investigating
import { getReactNativePersistence } from "firebase/auth/dist/rn/persistence";

// Initialize Firebase with persistence
let auth;
try {
  auth = getAuth();
} catch {
  auth = initializeAuth(app, {
    persistence: getReactNativePersistence(AsyncStorage),
  });
}
```

## Technology Stack
